
Work Items for World-O-Music
=============================

Software
---------
Rework NMEA parsing code to generate binary numbers with known bit variation

Write utility bit-extraction functions

Write GPS simulation for dev purposes

Extend tune structure to do per-note volumes 

Sort out our terminology for notes & voices and fix the code

Build tune generation, varying:
 - Speed
 - Notes in use
 - Specific notes in tune
 - Rhythm
 - Stress
 - Time signature ?
 - Voices in use ? 
 
Equalise volumes of the various voices


Hardware
---------

Measure current consumption of the hardware, work out if low-pass-filtering the PWM signal will save power

Pick a battery pack to get a decent runtime

Find an amp/speaker

Find tube to fit parts

Build case
